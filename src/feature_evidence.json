      "featureTitle": "Add romantic sound effects to the Valentine intro experience (the rose-petal “Will you be my Valentine?” overlay) in a way that works with browser autoplay rules (i.e., sound plays only after a user interaction). Include at least: (1) a subtle ambient romantic background audio while the intro overlay is visible, and (2) a short confirmation sound when the user clicks “Yes! 💖”. Provide a simple, visible mute/unmute control on the intro overlay and default to muted until the first user interaction enables audio.",
