  "summary": "REQ-10/11/12 are largely implemented: a new intro-overlay audio hook adds muted-by-default ambient + confirm SFX with a visible mute control and user-interaction unlocking; hero sub-line text is updated; intro overlay background blur appears removed in favor of a solid full-screen backdrop. One notable gap is that the diff does not include the referenced audio asset files, so the sound effects may not actually work at runtime.",

      "requirement": "Provide romantic ambient audio and a short confirmation sound effect for the intro overlay experience.",
      "reason": "The hook references two audio files at '/assets/audio/valentine-ambient.mp3' and '/assets/audio/valentine-confirm.mp3', but no corresponding audio assets are shown as added/modified in the diff summary. Without these files in the public assets, the feature would fail to play actual sounds.",
